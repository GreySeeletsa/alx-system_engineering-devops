0x0F-load_balancer


	-Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.* A lo	ad balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a 	manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance.

Tasks

	For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the ta	sk requirements.
